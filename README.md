# Kostya Bakay Media Player
This is Android online music player, which works with [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) API and with [vk.com](https://vk.com) SDK. You can 
listen your local tracks and top tracks from the [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music) chart, also you can get information about artist or 
track from the [last.fm](https://www.last.fm). The main idea is that the application takes data from the [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) and 
plays corresponding tracks from the [vk.com](https://vk.com). Pre-alpha version of this application was created for the Android Spring Camp 
which was organized by [Vakoms](https://vakoms.com) company.
